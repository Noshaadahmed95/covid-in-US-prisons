Until early November, West Virginia’s Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation reported staff cases for juvenile facilities and jails combined with prisons and work release. After they began providing itemized numbers on staff cases on Nov. 3, we only included staff numbers from prisons and work release sites in our data releases. In our online tracker, we have gone back to the past weeks of data and estimated the staff breakdown based on the overall size of the staff for each sector."
